### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdelali from morocco, I do full-time freelancing as a full-stack web developer, love building applications that help businesses, not only in automating tasks and saving time but also in streamlining business processes and helping in decision making. I had started with PHP as baseline language to build applications faster, and then tried and mastered some of the prominent frameworks like Laravel, CI, Symfony, Vue js, Nuxt js, etc. Also considering front-end being an essential piece of the puzzle

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ðŸ¤£
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to coding and play games.
